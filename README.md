# Movie Data Cleaning
## Overview
This project involved creating a function that would automate an ETL process on raw data. In this example, the function would scrape, clean, organize, and merge raw data on movies released since 1990 from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens. This readable data was then organized into two tables: one for information on the movies and another for information on the movies' ratings. These tables would finally be loaded into a PostgreSQL database, ready to be utilized for further analysis.
